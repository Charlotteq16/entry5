        <p class="thoughts">This is something I would repeatedly hear from my dad as a kid. He is a very confident person, while I was the complete opposite. My shyness was my biggest enemy. It was to the point where in every photo taken of me in Pre-k, I was frowning, because I didn't like the attention. It wasn't until my senior year of highschool that my dads words stuck with me. I realized there was no reason to be afraid of anyone or anything At the end of the day we are all just people living our lives one day at a time. Thats when I stopped caring about people's opinion, because most of them aren't helpful to me anyway so why should I care. I still have my moments of shyness sometimes, but thats when I remind myself there is literally no reason to be afraid.</p>
